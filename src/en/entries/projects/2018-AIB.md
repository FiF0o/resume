The Mortgages Applications Service App provide end users with an easy to use, faster, omnichannel experience where it is possible to interact with AIB agents, share documents for mortages. I was a Full stack front-end developer and my responsibilities included:
- Implementation of features, bug fixing, unit tests (Jest, Enzyme) and a living styleguide.
- Supporting our Agile framework and ways of working, helping with backlog prioritisation and various team facilitation techniques/ceremonies.
- Building Reactjs, Redux, Sagas (async) and functional programming patterns.
I also improved code coverage and overall CSS architecture which led to bug reduction. The Team successfully launched the service despite the tight timeline.
