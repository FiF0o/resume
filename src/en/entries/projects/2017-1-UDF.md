Started engagement with Lloyds in July 2016 as a front-end engineer.
While assigned to a dev team, I performed contextual enquiry across teams to understand current ways of working as well as recurring pain points occurred which led to fundings (assisted with the help of other stakeholders) for the implementation a design system at Lloyds in March 2017.
- Build LLoyds Banking Group design system for customer facing applications. Component library was created for omni channel applications (React, Storybook, Sass)
- Implementation of several living styleguides (react, storybook, nodejs) cross brands for Lloyds Retail Banking web applications as well being a core contributor of LLoyds core developers to code the design system API.
- Defining with the client new ways of working to change the culture and making sure the design system will scale up successfully.
