Digital transformation project to help Prudential reduce requests from customers to call centers as well as increase online presence for client self services such as pensions, insurance products. My responsibilities included:
- Defining UX strategy, product roadmap as well mitigation plans.
- Defining User Research & User testing.
- Performing Qualitative & Quantitative research.
The project led to a win for Wipro Digital (one of the first project won by Wipro Digital since it has been created).
Other partners such as BCG have been rolling off the account and replaced by Wipro & Wipro Digital.
