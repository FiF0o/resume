The project was a response to an RFP for a digital transformation project.
6 weeks accelerator project to showcase Wipro Digital design capability.
The client team was located in the US as well as the main sponsor of the project.
It consisted in several design iterations (sprint) as well as defining a brand for the new self service portal. My responsibilities included:
- Managing project as well as stakeholders.
- Creating wireframes & visual designs.
- Perfoming User Research.
Led to a Â£2M project, one of the first big project win after Wipro Digital unit has been created.
