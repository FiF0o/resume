Renault is a French multinational automobile manufacturer.
I joined the HFE & Ergonomics department in charge of creating product specifications and testing and was assigned to projects for cars ranging from 15 to â‚¬45k.
Main projects included the MMI/HMI specifications of their new gear shit as well as working closely with product design teams for its design and implementation.
I also created specifications for their suppliers to implement to new generation of touch screens (7' & 9') to be embedded in the dashboards as well as its information architecture and design (wirefames & UI). Worked closely with the researchers to follow up on user testing sessions and market/competitor research.

This was the most challenging environement I have ever worked with.
